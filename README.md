# Sky Hopper

An addictive 2D game where you control a bird navigating through pipes, implemented in Python using the Pygame library.

## Description

In Sky Hopper, your objective is to guide a bird through gaps in a series of pipes by flapping its wings. The bird falls due to gravity, and your job is to make the bird flap by pressing a key (typically the spacebar) to stay afloat and avoid hitting the pipes. The game continues until the bird collides with a pipe or the ground, and your score increases every time you successfully pass through a gap.

This game is a great way to get started with game development using Pygame and Python. It focuses on essential game mechanics like collision detection, player movement, and scoring.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive controls (press space to make the bird flap)
- Endless gameplay with increasingly difficult pipe placements
- Real-time score tracking displayed on the screen
- Challenging and addictive gameplay
